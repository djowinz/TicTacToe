# TicTacToe
just a simple Unity tic-tac-toe game implementing (configurable minimax, with alpha-beta pruning and quiescence searching)


## Implementation
Most of this implementation was done using unity's UI interface. Elements are just simple box elements with buttons and text inputs.
Nothing fancy here. The goal of this project was to get a larger understanding of MiniMax algorithm and apply it to a larger game.
I have another game called AmericanCheckers that has a configurable (AI) set from easy medium or hard. The implementation for the AI
is straight forward, and using depth reduces the (intuitive) decision making of the AI, as it will make dumb moves due to the horizon effect.

## Inspiration
Just to get a better understanding of game based algorithms and implementing them in a varity of board games. Eventually leading to the
conclusion of a fully 3D chess game implementing all levels of the minimax algorithm.

## Notes
While this is a good example, please don't take this code as blind faith of proper implementation. This was done through my own learning
and understanding of the minimax algorithm, while the code is abtuse in some aspects. It's only intended as a working prototype for educational
purposes.
